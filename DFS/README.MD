There are many Applications of DFS .

---> Finding Articulation Points and Bridges in a Graph .

---> Finding Strongly Connected Components in a Directed graph

---> Finding Connected Component in a Undirected Graph .

---> Finding Cycles in Graph 

---> Topological Sorting of Nodes in Directed Graph .

---> Checking a Undirected Graph if it a tree or not ?

---> Given a Directed Graph Find Such node from where 
    Maximum Number of Nodes can be visited .
	
---> Longest Path in a Unweighted Directed Acyclic Graph
     using DFS and DP
	 
---> Giving Direction to an Undirected Connected Graph So that
    Number of SCC is minimal
	
---> Making a Undiected Connected Graph Strongly Connected By
     giving DIrected to edges .
	 
---> Minimum Number of edges to make a Undirected Connected Graph Stronhly Connected .

---> Shortest Path in a Tree using DFS .
