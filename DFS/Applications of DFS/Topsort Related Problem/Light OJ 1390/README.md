# Simplification of Problem Statement : 1

Given a directed acyclic graph, we need to remove all the edges vi â†’ vj if vj is reachable from vi by some other path. In a word we need to remove the extra edges which are already included in some other path . Resulted Total Number of Edges should be as minimum as possible .
